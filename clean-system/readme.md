📁 clean-system

This script performs a basic system cleanup on Ubuntu. It is designed to free up disk space and improve system performance by removing:

    APT package manager cache

    User cache files (~/.cache)

    Temporary files (/tmp and /var/tmp)

    Old thumbnail cache (~/.cache/thumbnails)

Usage:
Run the script with execution permissions:
```
chmod +x clean.sh
./clean.sh
```
